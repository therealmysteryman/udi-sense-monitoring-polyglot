# Sense Monitoring Polyglot V2 Node Server

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/therealmysteryman/udi-sense-monitoring-polyglot.svg?branch=master)

This Poly provides an interface between Sense Monitoring using undocumented API and Polyglot v2 server. Provide Electricity Usage and Status of a Device. This use undocumented API from Sense via a Python Library (https://github.com/scottbonline/sense).
